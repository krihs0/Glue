# Glue route system

## By Kris and Robin  

### The assignment

***

The briefing (in dutch) can be found [here](Briefing-GLUE-digital-map.pdf). But in here i will also shortly explain what the assignment was.

We had to create a route system based on the already existing map with its locations on it. You had to be able to only see the included locations of the currently selected route and then be able to switch between a few routes. For every route there should come a way to follow that route, that could be in the browser or with a third party app such as google maps.

The plan was also to put a paywall before the route system wich was eventually not included.

We were also asked to improve the overall performance of the website.

### Way of building

***

Because the website uses the Wordpress framework/foundation it was very limiting to what we could do. We decided on creating some html code that we would put in a code block included in Wordpress. We Created a peice of html code wich included Javscript and CSS in itself because we couldnt make separate files for that.  

The code can be found [here](RouteMap-Pagina.html)

Kris created most of the visual appearance of the route page and made the system that makes you able to switch between routes and then view them.  
Robin created the buttons that redirect you to the right google maps route and the system behind that.  
Robin also created a paywall page wich was eventually not used.

### Other stuff

***

Along the way we were also asked to fix some things that went wrong on the website. One of these thing were the dissapeared css of the info bubbles on the maps. For that Kris created the below linked pieces of code wich the staff of glue can use for making the info bubbles.

[HUB-template.html]((%20HUB%20-%20Template%20).html)
